# BurnMyWallet.com Frontend

The source code for the front-end can be found here. Preview a live demo of this [here](http://burnmywallet.vercel.app/). If you are looking for the source code for smart contracts, head over to [/smart-contracts](/smart-contracts/).

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

1. Run `yarn install` inside the frontend directory
2. Create and fill out the `.env` file based on `.env.sample`:

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the pages by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
