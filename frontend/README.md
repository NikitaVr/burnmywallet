# NFT Minting Dapp Starter Kit Frontend

The source code for the front-end can be found here. Preview a live demo of this [here](https://basic-sample-dapp.vercel.app). If you are looking for the source code for smart contracts, head over to [/smart-contracts](/smart-contracts/).

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

1. Run `yarn install` inside the frontend directory
2. Create and fill out the `.env` file based on `.env.sample`:

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the pages by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

## API Routes (optional)

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on like so: [http://localhost:3000/api/giftlist?address={address}](http://localhost:3000/api/giftlist?address=0x0). The endpoints can be edited in the `pages/api` directory.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
