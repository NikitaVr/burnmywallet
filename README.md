# Burn My Wallet ðŸ”¥

With Soul Bound Tokens, Pass cards, and education / work certificates being tied to your account, a hacker gaining access to your account can impersonate you, and gain access to other systems to cause some damage.

Hackers can get your mnemonic, but they can't lock you out of your account. This means if your wallet was hacked, you can still trigger a "kill switch" to mark your wallet as hacked.

Burn My Wallet mintS a Soul Bound Token to mark your account as Hacked/Burned.
